# Calculator_Simple_RUBY
This is a calculator based on Ruby.
This for now only works with + (plus).
It is an work for learning code, so, you can take it if you are a student who is learning Ruby.
As you can see after you run the RUBY app, it is on english, if you need to change it, do it after you download the code or app.
It will ask for the fisrt value, put the number you want, then ENTER. After that will ask for the next value, introduce it and enter again.

You can see the code and it have val1 and val2 = gets.chomp and then val1 and val2 = .to_i to translate them from text to numbers.

Update v0.2.1
-Added support for +, -, /, *

Next updates will support decimals.

Please support my work and help me :)
